# About 
This is a simple weather aplication that takes the input of a city and displays the current weather for that city. All the cities are stored in a local array so they can be used later if your close the app and when you refresh it displays the last cities you searched for. There is also a uvindex that can show you the if the uv conditions are favorable.
